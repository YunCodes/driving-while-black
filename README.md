# Driving While Black
This is a nationwide project I led at the ABC-Owned Television Stations after the death of George Floyd. In this project, I assessed racial disparities in policing by compiling and analyzing 20 million traffic stops from 12 jurisdictions across the country. 

My findings were aired locally at all eight stations, and also nationally on ABC News’ Nightline, Good Morning America, and World News Tonight. They were also featured in “Turning Point,” a month-long special reporting on racial justice, which brought ABC News a 2021 National Edward Murrow’s Award in Excellence in Diversity, Equity and Innovation.
